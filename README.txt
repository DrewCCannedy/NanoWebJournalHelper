NanoWeb Journal Helper Application

Created in Python3 by Drew Cannedy, (dxc142830@utdallas.edu)

ONLY USABLE ON WINDOWS

This was created to help in doing NanoWeb Journal Tasks.
If you arent doing NanoWeb Journal Tasks, it probably will not be helpful.

3) Open the emails.txt file in the 'Journals' folder.
4) Replace the first line with your first and last name
5) Go to the 'NanoWeb_Journal_Helper' folder
6) Open the 'Dist' folder and doubleclick on the NanoWeb_Journal_Helper.exe

REMOVE ZEROS:

This will remove all excel sheets with a total of $0 and delete excel files without any sheets

_________________________________________________________________________________

SEND EMAILS: 

This will email every professor who has an attachment in the folder entered. 
The emails.txt file contains emails for professors who I have sent an email to before.
You may need to add a new professor someday. To do so, start a new line.

The format for the line is
Firstname Lastname, email, ccemail(if any)

Make sure the first name and last name are as they appear in the excel files
for all emails, leave off the 'utdallas.edu' part. 
You can include any ammount of CC emails, just make sure to seperate them with ','

CREATE MONTHLY REPORT:

This will create the report to send to OPM, and a template for how you will fill out the JRNL1
It creates an excel file named 'copy' in the JRNL1 folder. 
After, copy this file and rename it to 'NanoWeb_Month_Year' and put it in the journals folder
NEVER DELETE OR REMOVE the copy file or it will not create the monthly report
